<h1> List of examples </h1>

<p><a href="/">Go back</a></p></br>

<p>
<a href="/?example=1">Example 1</a>: Alice and Bob and both necessary to produce something which has value 1500. Alice is player 1, Bob is player 2.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=2">Example 2</a>: Alice and Bob are each individually responsible for two different projects, each of which has value 1000. Alice is player 1, Bob is player 2.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=3">Example 3</a>: Newton and Leibniz invented calculus at the same time. It has a value of 100, in arbitrary units. Assumption: Nobody else could have invented calculus. Newton is player 1, Leibniz is player 2
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=4">Example 4</a>: Netwon invented Calculus. Leibniz, mad with envy, pretended that he also invented calculus at the same time. Newton is player 1. Lebniz is player 2.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=5">Example 5</a>: Suppose that the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) will spend $1M on a malaria net distribution. As a result of AMF's commitment, the Gates Foundation contributes $400,000. If AMF had not acted, Gates would have spent the $400,000 on something else, half as valuable. AMF is player 1, Gates is player 2.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=6">Example 6</a>: Suppose again that AMF commits $1m to a net distribution. But if AMF had put nothing in, DFID would instead have committed $500,000 to the net distribution. Now, DFID commits that money to something half as valuable. AMF is player 1, DFID is player 2.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=7">Example 7</a>: 7 people boil a goat in their mother's milk, independently and at the same time. According to the Kabbalah, this has terrible implications: -1000 value is lost. Suppose that all the damage is done once the first deed is done.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=8">Example 8</a>: Suppose that there was a position in an EA org, for which there were 6 qualified applicants which are otherwise 'idle'. In arbitrary units, the person in that position in that organization can produce an impact of 100 utility. Applicants are players 1-6, the organization is player 7.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=9">Example 9</a>: A small Indian state with 10 million inhabitants spends $60 million to vaccinate 30% of their population. An NGO which would otherwise be doing something really ineffective, comes in, and by sending reminders, increases the vaccination rate to 35%. They do this very cheaply, for $100,000. The government is player 1, the indian state is player 2. What if, instead, the NGO would have done something equally valuable?
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=10">Example 10</a> 1: Same as <a href="../?example=x">Example 9</a>,  but now there are 6 government subagencies, each of which we consider as a distinct agent. The NGO is player 1, government agencies are players 2-7.
</p></br><p>
<a href="/?example=11">Example 11:</a> An organization organizes a costless online vote to pass a measure of value 1, and it passes if it gets more than 3 votes. 7 people vote in favour
